# RAG System Requirements
# Core ML Libraries

## Curated requirements for deployment (Streamlit Cloud / simple servers)
## Keep this file minimal to reduce build time. Move heavy libs to optional section below.

# Web UI
streamlit>=1.20.0

# Core APIs
openai>=2.6.0
pinecone>=7.3.0

# Retrieval / utils
rank-bm25==0.2.2
numpy>=1.23
PyYAML>=6.0
requests>=2.32.0

# Optional / heavy (may increase build time on hosted platforms)
# If you need local embedding models, uncomment these and ensure the platform can install them.
# sentence-transformers==5.1.2
# torch==2.9.0
# transformers==4.57.1

# Notes:
# - For stability on hosted platforms, prefer OpenAI Embeddings (set OPENAI_API_KEY) as fallback
#   instead of installing heavy local transformer libraries.

# Web UI
streamlit>=1.20.0
